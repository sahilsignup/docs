# Options

Swup has a several options that can be passed into a constructor as an object.

```javascript
const options = {};
const swup = new Swup(options);
```

## Link Selector

Link selector defines link elements that will trigger the transition. By default, the selector takes any link with `href` attribute starting with `/`, `#` or current domain.
You can modify this option to include SVG links or exclude some other.

```javascript
const options = {
  linkSelector:
    'a[href^="' +
    window.location.origin +
    '"]:not([data-no-swup]), a[href^="/"]:not([data-no-swup]), a[href^="#"]:not([data-no-swup])'
};
```

In case you want to exclude links for some routes, lightbox or any other functionality, extend the selector.
By default, you can add `[data-no-swup]` attribute to the link, if you want to exclude just a few.

## Animation Selector

As swup is built on animations, it is required to define the elements that are being animated. Usually, you would like to give the elements some common class or class prefix.
By default option is set to `[class*='transition-']`, which selects all elements with class attribute containing `transition-`.  
Note that class `swup-...` is also used internally by swup (for example `swup-enabled`), so setting the option to `[class*='swup-']` won't work. Use `[class*='swup-transition-']` instead.

```javascript
const options = {
  animationSelector: '[class*="transition-"]'
};
```

## Containers

Containers option defines the array of selectors of containers, where the content needs to be replaced.
Containers option usually contains the main element with the content of the page, but can include any element that is present across all pages.
This creates a possibility of animating elements on the page while still replacing it's parts.
Another good example where this is helpful is the _change language_ link, which usually appears the same across the site (no animation needed),
but leads to a different URL on each page.
Option defaults to the single container of id `#swup`.  
**Note:** Keep in mind that only elements **inside** of `body` tag are supported.

```javascript
const options = {
  containers: ["#swup"]
};
```

## Cache

Swup has a built-in cache, meaning that it stores previously loaded contents of the pages in memory in a form of an object.
This drastically improves speed for static sites but should be disabled for dynamic sites. Cache option defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const options = {
  cache: true
};
```

## Request Headers

Swup sets two headers of the request by default and headers can be adjusted with `requestHeaders` option.
This can be useful for returning custom response from a server, or any other processing on a server side.

```javascript
const options = {
  requestHeaders: {
    "X-Requested-With": "swup", // so we can tell request comes from swup
    Accept: "text/html, application/xhtml+xml" // to explicitly define what response we are expecting
  }
};
```

## Skip popState Handling

Swup is built around browser history API, but sometimes some other tools manipulating the browser history can be used as well.
For this reason, swup places a source property into every history state object it creates, so it can be later identified (swup also modifies current history record on start, to include the "swup" source property as well).
On `popState` events, swup only handles the records that were created by swup.
This behavior can be modified by `skipPopStateHandling` option, which is represented by a function returning boolean (false = handle the popstate, true = do nothing).
The function accepts one argument - the popstate event. Option defaults to the following:

```javascript
const options = {
  skipPopStateHandling: function(event) {
    if (event.state && event.state.source == "swup") {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
};
```

## Animate History Browsing

This option enables the animations also if navigating using the browser history. Swup adds the class `is-popstate` to the html tag for the whole process of the animation on back/forward browsing.

```javascript
const options = {
  animateHistoryBrowsing: false
};
```

⚠️ **Important Note**: This option was added to Swup due to popular request but should be used with caution. When the option is set to `true`, Swup has to disable all native browser scrolling behavior (sets [scrollRestoration](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/history-api-scroll-restoration) to `manual`). We encourage you do strongly consider the consequences of doing so: 

The scroll positions on previous page(s) or between page reloads are **not being preserved** (but [can be implemented manually](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues/48#issuecomment-423854819) based on the use case). Otherwise, Swup will scroll to the top/#element on `popstate` as the browser would do. The default value is `false`.

## Default Options

The default option object look like...

```javascript
const options = {
  animateHistoryBrowsing: false,
  animationSelector: '[class*="transition-"]',
  containers: ["#swup"],
  cache: true,
  linkSelector:
    'a[href^="' +
    window.location.origin +
    '"]:not([data-no-swup]), a[href^="/"]:not([data-no-swup]), a[href^="#"]:not([data-no-swup])',
  skipPopStateHandling: function(event) {
    if (event.state && event.state.source == "swup") {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
};
```
